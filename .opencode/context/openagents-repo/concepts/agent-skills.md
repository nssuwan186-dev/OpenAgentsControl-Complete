# Agent Skills

**Purpose**: Markdown files that teach Claude how to do specific tasks

---

## Core Concept

A Skill is a `SKILL.md` file that teaches Claude specialized knowledge. Skills are **model-invoked**: Claude automatically applies them based on task context matching the description field.

---

## Key Points

- Skills live in `~/.claude/skills/` (personal) or `.claude/skills/` (project)
- Each skill needs a directory with `SKILL.md` inside
- Name and description in YAML frontmatter are required
- Claude loads only name/description at startup (lazy loading)
- Full content loaded when skill is activated

---

## Skill File Format

```yaml
---
name: explaining-code
description: Explains code with diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works.
---

When explaining code, always include:
1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare to everyday life
2. **Draw a diagram**: ASCII art for flow/structure
3. **Walk through the code**: Step-by-step
4. **Highlight a gotcha**: Common mistakes
```
